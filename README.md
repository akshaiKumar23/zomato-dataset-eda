This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consists of information about various restaurants in Bangalore, including their names, locations, cuisines, user ratings, and more. The goal of this EDA is to gain insights into the restaurant landscape of Bangalore and uncover interesting trends and patterns.

## Dataset

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this analysis, we explore various aspects of the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset. Some of the key questions we aim to answer include:

1. What are the most common types of restaurants in Bangalore?
2. How does the average cost for two people vary across different types of restaurants?
3. Are restaurants with online ordering and table booking more likely to have higher ratings?
4. What are the popular cuisines in Bangalore and how do they correlate with user ratings?

To find the answers, we perform data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis on the dataset.
